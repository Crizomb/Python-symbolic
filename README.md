# Python-symbolic

Python-symbolic is a small project written in pure Python that allows you to perform symbolic mathematics on your computer. The focus is on readability and simplicity.

## Features

### Done:
- Default type definitions
- Expression tree implementation
- Transformation of infix strings to expression trees
- Visualization of expression trees
- Expansion of expressions (e.g., `a*(a+b)` to `a^2 + ab`)

### To-Do:
- Create a type (BinOperator) for exponents
- Implement complex numbers
- Modify expression trees, including:
  - Factorization of expressions (e.g., `a^2 + 2ab + b^2` to `(a+b)^2`)
  - Easy simplification (e.g., `sin(x)² + cos(x)²` to `1`)
- Define calculus types:
  - Derivative
  - Integral
  - Sum
  - Product
  - Limit
